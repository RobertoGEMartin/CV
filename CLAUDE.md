# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

This is a personal CV/resume document repository, not a code project. It contains professional profile documents in various formats.

## Directory Structure

- `00_master/` - Master CV files in Markdown (EN/ES)
- `01_versions/` - Professional versions (Executive, Technical, etc.)
- `02_tailored/` - Specifically adapted CVs for companies
- `03_archive/` - Past years archive
- `Profile/` - Official profile exports and PDFs

## Working with Documents

Since this directory contains personal documents rather than code:

- Master files are in `00_master/` and should be the source for updates
- PDF files in `Profile/` cannot be directly edited
- Archived files in `03_archive/` are for reference

## Common Tasks

No build, test, or development commands are applicable to this repository as it contains only document files.
