# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

This is a personal CV/resume document repository, not a code project. It contains professional profile documents in various formats.

## Directory Structure

- `00_master/` - Master CV files in Markdown (EN/ES)
- `01_versions/` - Professional versions (Executive, Technical, etc.)
- `02_tailored/` - Specifically adapted CVs for companies
- `03_archive/` - Past years archive
- `Profile/` - Official profile exports and PDFs
  - `Estudios.md` - Education & Certifications source of truth
  - `publicaciones.md` - Publications source of truth
  - `proyectos.md` - Strategic Projects source of truth

## Authoritative Data Sources

The following files in `Profile/` are the **single source of truth** for their respective data points. Always check these files before updating CV content:

- **Projects**: `Profile/proyectos.md` (Contains TRLs, CV relevance, and strategic categorization)
- **Publications**: `Profile/publicaciones.md` (Contains prioritized list for Executive vs Technical CVs)
- **Education**: `Profile/Estudios.md` (Contains ranked certifications and academic background)

## Working with Documents

Since this directory contains personal documents rather than code:

- Master files are in `00_master/` and should be the source for updates
- PDF files in `Profile/` cannot be directly edited
- Archived files in `03_archive/` are for reference

## Common Tasks

No build, test, or development commands are applicable to this repository as it contains only document files.
