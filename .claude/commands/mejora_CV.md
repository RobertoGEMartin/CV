## 5. CORE PRINCIPLES

1. Executive impact over technical trivia
2. Every claim must answer: “So what?”
3. Quantification wherever possible
4. Perfect ES / EN consistency
5. Senior, sober, factual tone
6. No buzzwords, no hype

---

## 6. METRICS ENGINEERING (CRITICAL)

Before rewriting:

For each role or project, propose metrics in:

### Financial & Programme
- Budget managed (€)
- Funding secured (€)
- Programme size and duration

### Scale & Leadership
- Team size (direct / matrix)
- Stakeholders and institutions
- Systems or assets under responsibility

### Technical & Operational
- TRL progression
- Deployment level
- Performance improvements
- System criticality

### Domain-Specific
- Defence: NATO, STANAG, ENS, C4I
- Digital Twins: physics coupling, real-time limits
- Materials: discovery cycle reduction
- Energy: optimisation and control impact

Output a metrics table with:
- Metric
- Why it matters
- Status: ✅ Known | 🟡 Approx | 🔴 Missing

---

## 7. CV MASTER CREATION

Generate:

- RGEM_CV_MASTER_EN.md
- RGEM_CV_MASTER_ES.md

Structure:

2. Core Expertise & Strategic Domains
3. Professional Experience (impact-driven bullets)
4. Selected Strategic Programmes
5. Education & Advanced Training
6. Publications / Thought Leadership (only if relevant)

---

## 8. DERIVED VERSIONS

- Identify strengths and risks
- Explain why this CV would pass or fail a senior committee
- Recommend next improvements (v1.1, v1.2)

---

## 10. OUTPUT ORDER

1. Analysis of existing CVs
2. Metrics proposal table

6. Technical CV (EN / ES)
7. Final recommendations



### Additional Strategic & Quantitative Context (Authoritative)

You may assume the following high-level context when refining CV_AR,
but do NOT invent numbers. If exact figures are missing, ask explicitly.

1. Leadership & Scale (Cross-Project)
- Peak team size (direct + matrix) across AI programs: [X–Y engineers/researchers]
- Typical team composition: AI engineers, data scientists, domain experts, PhDs
- Number of concurrent strategic programs managed in parallel: [X]

2. Financial & Programmatic Responsibility
- Cumulative R&D budget under responsibility (EU + National + Industrial): [~€X–€Y million]
- Type of funding instruments handled:
  - EU R&D (EDF, Horizon Europe, Digital Europe)
  - National Defence programs (MoD / Navy)
  - Industrial contracts (Energy, Infrastructure)
- Role in funding lifecycle:
  - Technical lead for proposal definition
  - Architecture owner during execution
  - Technical authority in reviews and audits

3. Institutional Trust & Continuity
- Long-term strategic relationships with defence and critical-infrastructure clients
- Multiple program renewals / evolutions (e.g. SEDA → MADS)
- Responsibility over mission-critical or safety-critical systems

4. Decision-Level Impact (Not Execution)
- Ownership of architectural decisions constrained by:
  - Security (ENS, defence-grade requirements)
  - Operational deployment (edge, real-time, C4I integration)
  - Certification and auditability
- Experience making trade-off decisions between:
  - Accuracy vs robustness
  - Innovation vs deployability
  - Research ambition vs operational risk

5. Technical-to-Operational Translation
- Proven ability to move systems from:
  - Research / PoC (TRL 2–3)
  - Pilot / Pre-production (TRL 5–6)
  - Operational deployment (TRL 7+)
- Responsibility for ensuring explainability, maintainability, and long-term operability

Use this context to strengthen CV_AR by:
- Elevating language from "technical execution" to "strategic ownership"
- Highlighting risk management, scale, and decision authority
- Making the profile credible for CTO / Chief Architect / Executive AI roles

## FINAL RULE

Do not guess.
Ask explicitly if data is missing.
Apply senior professional judgment.
