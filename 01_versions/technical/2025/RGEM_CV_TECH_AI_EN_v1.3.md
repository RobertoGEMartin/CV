## Professional Experience

### **HI Iberia Ingeniería y Proyectos** | Madrid, Spain
**Director of Artificial Intelligence** | *2013 – Present*

*I lead the AI division to deliver state-of-the-art Deep Tech solutions for national security and critical infrastructure. I exercise full ownership of architectural decisions constrained by security (ENS, defence-grade requirements), operational deployment (edge, real-time, C4I integration), and certification/auditability.*

#### **Strategic Programmes: Defence & National Security**

- **IMINT Scaling & Data Fusion (SEDA / MADS - Spanish MoD)**:
  - **Architecture Ownership**: Directed the design and scaling of automated vessel and critical infrastructure detection systems using multi-source satellite data fusion (Multispectral, IR, SAR, AIS).
  - **Strategic Impact**: Evolved national surveillance capabilities by advancing the system from pilot (TRL 4) to operational deployment (TRL 7+), enabling autonomous threat detection across extensive maritime domains and polar environments.
  - **Decision Authority**: Defined critical trade-offs between model accuracy and robustness under adversarial conditions, ensuring explainability for defence analysts and compliance with ENS security standards.
  - **Institutional Trust**: Multi-year program with successive extensions, cementing long-term strategic partnership.

- **Generative AI for Wargaming & C2 (BELLONA - Armed Forces)**:
  - **Innovation Strategy**: Lead the definition of decision-support systems based on Large Language Models (LLMs) and autonomous agents for Course of Action (COA) generation.
  - **Operational Value**: Enhance Command & Control (C2) capabilities through automated scenario generation and adversarial wargaming (LVC), reducing cognitive load in high-stress decision environments.
  - **Status**: Advance from research validation to tactical pilot (TRL 4-6).

- **Predictive Maintenance & Fleet Readiness (MAPRE - Spanish Navy)**:
  - **Architecture Ownership**: Architected the predictive maintenance (PdM) framework for the Spanish Navy fleet, integrating IoT sensor data, Digital Twins, and Deep Learning-based failure forecasting.
  - **Strategic Impact**: Maximized vessel operational readiness and optimized logistics of high-value spare parts. Transformed maintenance posture from reactive to predictive, directly impacting fleet availability rates.
  - **Technical-to-Operational Translation**: Advanced the system from research PoC (TRL 3) to pre-production pilot (TRL 6), ensuring long-term operability in edge-disconnected maritime environments.
  - **Institutional Trust**: Consolidated technological positioning in the naval sector, aligning developments with Navy logistic requirements (LOGINT) and ensuring continuity of R&D investment.

#### **Strategic Programmes: Energy & Critical Infrastructure**

- **Autonomous Grid Control (ENIGMA - Red Eléctrica de España)**:
  - **Innovation Leadership**: Spearheaded the first use of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for autonomous control and stabilization of the national power grid, a safety-critical system with zero-tolerance for failure.
  - **Strategic Impact**: Established a benchmark for autonomous agent viability in high-stakes critical infrastructure. Demonstrated the safety and efficiency of AI-driven grid frequency stabilization and economic dispatch optimization.
  - **Decision Authority**: Balanced innovation ambition with operational risk, implementing rigorous testing and validation protocols to meet regulatory and safety requirements.
  - **Strategic Priority**: High-visibility initiative validating AI for critical national infrastructure.



#### **Strategic Programmes: Materials Discovery & Advanced Physics**

- **Materials Discovery & Particle Accelerator Optimization (LiOn-HD & DONES-FLUX)**:
  - **Innovation Leadership**: Direct the application of Generative AI and Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PiNNs) to accelerate Lithium-ion battery discovery and optimize IFMIF-DONES particle accelerators.
  - **Strategic Impact**: Achieved **100x simulation speedup** compared to traditional finite-element/CFD solvers, drastically reducing R&D cycles while maintaining physical consistency and scientific rigor.
  - **EU/National Trust**: Key component of the DLSM program, demonstrating capacity to lead deep-tech consortia.
  - **Technical Depth**: Bridged the gap between computational physics and machine learning, ensuring models respect conservation laws and boundary conditions.
